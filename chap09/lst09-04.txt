<!-- The Circle Shape. Users will be taken to circle.html if they
click inside of the circle. Like the htimage program, the circle
coordinates should be defined with the center and the radius. All
three numbers are comma separated. The Alt tag will be seen by
non-graphical browsers. -->

<AREA SHAPE=CIRCLE COORDS="35,35,32" HREF="circle.html" ALT="Circle">

<!-- The Rectangle Shape. Users will be taken to rect.html if they
click inside of the rectangle. The coordinates for the rectangle
should be the upper left (1) and lower right corners (2) of the
rectangle separated by commas, ie. COORDS="x1y1x2y2"-->

<AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="71,3,199,65" HREF="rect.html" ALT="Rectangle">

<!-- The Triangle is represented with a polygon shape. Coordinates
from the triangle vertices are comma separated. You can have as
many vertices as you wish, except for the fact that HTML limits an
attribute's value to 1024 characters in size. -->

<AREA SHAPE=POLY COORDS="225,63,296,63,261,4" HREF="poly.html" ALT="Triangle">

<!-- The Point attribute is not supported by the current Client-side
Image Maps specification, but to get around that we will use a
circle reference with a radius of 2, to create a point. -->

<AREA SHAPE=CIRCLE COORDS="326,30,2" HREF="point.html" ALT="Dot">

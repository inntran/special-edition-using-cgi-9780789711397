# Necessary Variables

# $baseurl defines the URL path to the directory that contains
# the images you wish to randomize.

$baseurl = "http://www.server.xxx/pics/";

# @files is an array which consists of the filenames, located at
# the URLs referenced with the $baseurl above that you wish to
# put in the randomizer.

@files = ("waterfalls.gif","test.gif","random.gif","neat.jpg");

# $uselog is a variable that allows you to choose whether or not
# you wish to log each time the random image generator generates
# a new picture.  If you choose to set this variable equal to '1'
# (thus turning it on), then the name of the image that was
# chosen will be saved to a log file.

$uselog = 0; # 1 = YES; 0 = NO

# If $uselog is set to '1', you must define this variable so that
# it points to the file that you want to contain the logged
# images.

$logfile = "/home/mattw/public_html/image/pics/piclog";
# Done
